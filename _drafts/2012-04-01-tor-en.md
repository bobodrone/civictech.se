Using Tor protects you against a common form of internet surveillance known as “traffic analysis.”

Individuals use Tor to keep websites from tracking them and their family members, or to connect to news sites, instant messaging services, or the like when these are blocked by their local Internet providers. Individuals also use Tor for socially sensitive communication: chat rooms and web forums for rape and abuse survivors, or people with illnesses.

Tor encrypts the original data, including the destination IP address, multiple times and sends it through a virtual circuit comprising successive, randomly selected Tor relays, provided by volunteers all over the world.

The final relay, also called an exit-node, decrypts the innermost layer of encryption and sends the original data to its destination without revealing, or even knowing, the source IP address.

Part of DFRI’s work in supporting Tor is to run exit-nodes. All of DFRI’s Tor relays are placed in Sweden. You can find more information about our relays from Atlas, Compass and Globe.
