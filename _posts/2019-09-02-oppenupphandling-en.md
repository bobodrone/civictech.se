In Sweden, public procurement was estimated to be worth a staggering 683 billion crowns in 2017([statistics from Konkurrensverket](http://www.konkurrensverket.se/globalassets/publikationer/rapporter/rapport_2018-9_statistikrapport_2018_webb.pdf)). Over 18000 tenders are launched each year by public institutions.

Currently, almost all of the related data is closed and unexploited.

Öppen Upphandling is a project aiming at opening public procurement data in Sweden. We do this by:
* raising awareness!
* assessing what the possibilities are for opening this data and what some of the blocking points could be;
* writing guides and setting standards to help the public actors to release the data in a painless and effective way;
* prototyping a selection of services around the data to showcase the possibilities;
* eventually building an ecosystem for innovation around procurement data that benefits all involved actors and saves public money!

The project has only started and we are currently in a preliminary phase to evaluate the needs. We are building a working group with motivated municipalities, government agencies private companies and journalists. Feel free to reach out if you are interested.
