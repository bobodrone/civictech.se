I (Pernilla, new project manager of Civic Tech Sweden) thought it'd be nice to meet up to socialise a bit before summer holidays. To keep enough "social distancing for socialising" I thought it'd be best to meet outdoors, in Humlegården behind Kungliga Biblioteket. I'll wear a turquoise hat so you can find us!  Everyone interested in meeting others working with digital technology for the common good is welcome! Bring your own picnic and drinks if your hungry/thirsty, but I'll also try to buy some snacks for us.
