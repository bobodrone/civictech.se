I (Pernilla, new project manager of Civic Tech Sweden) thought it'd be nice to meet up to socialise a bit before summer holidays. As it's raining in Stockholm today we'll have a virtual meetup instead so now everyone is welcome, not just "08:ers"! 17:00 at [https://public-meet2.glesys.com/CivicTechSthlm](https://public-meet2.glesys.com/CivicTechSthlm "https://public-meet2.glesys.com/CivicTechSthlm") ! 

You can also use the Jitsi Meet mobile app if you want to. Download it and click the link and and it should work. If not, you can go into the settings and enter [https://public-meet2.glesys.com](https://public-meet2.glesys.com "https://public-meet2.glesys.com") as a server and then CivicTechSthlm as room name on the main page.

Welcome!!
