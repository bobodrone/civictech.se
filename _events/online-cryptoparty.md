[Uppsala University CryptoParty](www.cryptoparty.se/uppsala/) invites you to an Online CryptoParty on Friday 23 October, 17:00-19:00.

Nowadays search engines (web and not) have a quite clear business case: they are either totally into privacy or not. Such case often boils down to better results vs privacy. But what does this mean from a relevancy perspective? Can privacy play a role in the search engine market? What about the often mentioned concepts "pure web" and "democratic search"?

A link to participate in the online session will be posted on [www.cryptoparty.se/uppsala/](www.cryptoparty.se/uppsala/) in advance and on the [Uppsala University CryptoParty mailinglist](https://lists.uu.se/sympa/subscribe/it-cryptoparty). 

Everyone is welcome! No prior knowledge required. 

[Uppsala University CryptoParty](www.cryptoparty.se/uppsala/) offers a learning space for all to introduce ourselves to the basic tools for self-protection in the digital space.
